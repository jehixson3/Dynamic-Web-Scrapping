Built a web application that scrapes data, images, and tables from various websites (NASA Mars News, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Mars Weather Twitter Account, Mars Fact page at Space Facts and the USGS Astrogeology) related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. Used a MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.  A button labeled "Scrape New Data" will update the page with the most current information on Mars
