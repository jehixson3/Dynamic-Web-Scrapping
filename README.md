Built a web application that scrapes data, images, and tables from various websites (NASA Mars News, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Mars Weather Twitter Account, Mars Fact page at Space Facts and the USGS Astrogeology sites) related to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. Using a MongoDB with Flask templating the HTML page displays all of the information that was scraped from the multiple URLs above.  A button labeled "Scrape New Data" will update the page with the most current information on Mars.

The orginal code was written and tested in jupyter notebook then transfered to python.  A mongoDB was used to hold the current information using a Flask server.
